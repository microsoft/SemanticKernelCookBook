       "  'content': 'In this lesson, we will walk through the major milestones in the history of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The history of artificial intelligence (AI) as a field is intertwined with the history of machine learning, as the algorithms and computational advances that underpin ML fed into the development of AI. It is useful to remember that, while these fields as distinct areas of inquiry began to crystallize in the 1950s, important algorithmic, statistical, mathematical, computational and technical discoveries predated and overlapped this era. In fact, people have been thinking about these questions for hundreds of years: this article discusses the historical intellectual underpinnings of the idea of a \\'thinking machine.\\'\\n\\nNotable discoveries:\\n- 1763, 1812 Bayes Theorem and its predecessors. This theorem and its applications underlie inference, describing the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge.\\n- 1805 Least Square Theory by French mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre. This theory, which you will learn about in our Regression unit, helps in data fitting.\\n- 1913 Markov Chains, named after Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, is used to describe a sequence of possible events based on a previous state.\\n- 1957 Perceptron is a type of linear classifier invented by American psychologist Frank Rosenblatt that underlies advances in deep learning.\\n- 1967 Nearest Neighbor is an algorithm originally designed to map routes. In an ML context it is used to detect patterns.\\n- 1970 Backpropagation is used to train feedforward neural networks.\\n- 1982 Recurrent Neural Networks are artificial neural networks derived from feedforward neural networks that create temporal graphs.\\n\\n1950: Machines that think\\nAlan Turing, a truly remarkable person who was voted by the public in 2019 as the greatest scientist of the 20th century, is credited as helping to lay the foundation for the concept of a \\'machine that can think.\\' He grappled with naysayers and his own need for empirical evidence of this concept in part by creating the Turing Test, which you will explore in our NLP lessons.\\n\\n1956: Dartmouth Summer Research Project\\n\"The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on artificial intelligence was a seminal event for artificial intelligence as a field,\" and it was here that the term \\'artificial intelligence\\' was coined.\\n\\n1956 - 1974: \"The golden years\"\\nFrom the 1950s through the mid \\'70s, optimism ran high in the hope that AI could solve many problems. In 1967, Marvin Minsky stated confidently that \"Within a generation ... the problem of creating \\'artificial intelligence\\' will substantially be solved.\" (Minsky, Marvin (1967), Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall)\\n\\n1974 - 1980: \"AI Winter\"\\nBy the mid 1970s, it had become apparent that the complexity of making \\'intelligent machines\\' had been understated and that its promise, given the available compute power, had been overblown. Funding dried up and confidence in the field slowed.\\n\\n1980s Expert systems\\nAs the field grew, its benefit to business became clearer, and in the 1980s so did the proliferation of \\'expert systems\\'. \"Expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence (AI) software.\" This type of system is actually hybrid, consisting partially of a rules engine defining business requirements, and an inference engine that leveraged the rules system to deduce new facts.\\n\\n1987 - 1993: AI \\'Chill\\'\\nThe proliferation of specialized expert systems hardware had the unfortunate effect of becoming too specialized. The rise of personal computers also competed with these large, specialized, centralized systems. The democratization of computing had begun, and it eventually paved the way for the modern explosion of big data.\\n\\n1993 - 2011\\nThis epoch saw a new era for ML and AI to be able to solve some of the problems that had been caused earlier by the lack of data and compute power. The amount of data began to rapidly increase and become more widely available, for better and for worse, especially with the advent of the smartphone around 2007. Compute power expanded exponentially, and algorithms evolved alongside. The field began to gain maturity as the freewheeling days of the past began to crystallize into a true discipline.\\n\\nNow\\nToday machine learning and AI touch almost every part of our lives. This era calls for careful understanding of the risks and potentials effects of these algorithms on human lives. It remains to be seen what the future holds, but it is important to understand these computer systems and the software and algorithms that they run. We hope that this curriculum will help you to gain a better understanding so that you can decide for yourself.'},\n",

       "  'content': \"On a high level, the craft of creating machine learning (ML) processes is comprised of a number of steps: Decide on the question, Collect and prepare data, Choose a training method, Train the model, Evaluate the model, Parameter tuning, Predict. Computers are particularly skilled at discovering hidden patterns in data. Before starting to build your model, there are several tasks you need to complete such as collecting and preparing data, selecting features and target, visualizing data, and splitting the dataset. Building a model involves deciding on a training method, training the model, and evaluating its performance. Parameter tuning can be done to improve the model. Finally, prediction is the process of using new data to test the model's accuracy.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"Welcome to this course on classical machine learning for beginners! Whether you're completely new to this topic, or an experienced ML practitioner looking to brush up on an area, we're happy to have you join us! We want to create a friendly launching spot for your ML study and would be happy to evaluate, respond to, and incorporate your feedback. Before starting with this curriculum, you need to have your computer set up and ready to run notebooks locally. Use the following links to learn how to install Python in your system and setup a text editor for development. It's also recommended to have a basic understanding of Python, a programming language useful for data scientists that we use in this course. We also use JavaScript a few times in this course when building web apps, so you will need to have node and npm installed, as well as Visual Studio Code available for both Python and JavaScript development. Since you found us here on GitHub, you might already have an account, but if not, create one and then fork this curriculum to use on your own. Familiarize yourself with Scikit-learn, a set of ML libraries that we reference in these lessons. The term 'machine learning' is one of the most popular and frequently used terms of today. There is a nontrivial possibility that you have heard this term at least once if you have some sort of familiarity with technology, no matter what domain you work in. The mechanics of machine learning, however, are a mystery to most people. For a machine learning beginner, the subject can sometimes feel overwhelming. Therefore, it is important to understand what machine learning actually is, and to learn about it step by step, through practical examples. We live in a universe full of fascinating mysteries. Great scientists such as Stephen Hawking, Albert Einstein, and many more have devoted their lives to searching for meaningful information that uncovers the mysteries of the world around us. This is the human condition of learning: a human child learns new things and uncovers the structure of their world year by year as they grow to adulthood. A child's brain and senses perceive the facts of their surroundings and gradually learn the hidden patterns of life which help the child to craft logical rules to identify learned patterns. The learning process of the human brain makes humans the most sophisticated living creature of this world. Learning continuously by discovering hidden patterns and then innovating on those patterns enables us to make ourselves better and better throughout our lifetime. This learning capacity and evolving capability is related to a concept called brain plasticity. Superficially, we can draw some motivational similarities between the learning process of the human brain and the concepts of machine learning. The human brain perceives things from the real world, processes the perceived information, makes rational decisions, and performs certain actions based on circumstances. This is what we called behaving intelligently. When we program a facsimile of the intelligent behavioral process to a machine, it is called artificial intelligence (AI). Although the terms can be confused, machine learning (ML) is an important subset of artificial intelligence. ML is concerned with using specialized algorithms to uncover meaningful information and find hidden patterns from perceived data to corroborate the rational decision-making process. In this curriculum, we are going to cover only the core concepts of machine learning that a beginner must know. We cover what we call 'classical machine learning' primarily using Scikit-learn, an excellent library many students use to learn the basics. To understand broader concepts of artificial intelligence or deep learning, a strong fundamental knowledge of machine learning is indispensable, and so we would like to offer it here. In this course you will learn: core concepts of machine learning, the history of ML, ML and fairness, regression ML techniques, classification ML techniques, clustering ML techniques, natural language processing ML techniques, time series forecasting ML techniques, reinforcement learning, real-world applications for ML. To make for a better learning experience, we will avoid the complexities of neural networks, 'deep learning' - many-layered model-building using neural networks - and AI, which we will discuss in a different curriculum. We also will offer a forthcoming data science curriculum to focus on that aspect of this larger field. Machine learning, from a systems perspective, is defined as the creation of automated systems that can learn hidden patterns from data to aid in making intelligent decisions. Applications of machine learning are now almost everywhere, and are as ubiquitous as the data that is flowing around our societies, generated by our smart phones, connected devices, and other systems. Considering the immense potential of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, researchers have been exploring their capability to solve multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary real-life problems with great positive outcomes. You can use machine learning in many ways: To predict the likelihood of disease from a patient's medical history or reports, to leverage weather data to predict weather events, to understand the sentiment of a text, to detect fake news to stop the spread of propaganda. Finance, economics, earth science, space exploration, biomedical engineering, cognitive science, and even fields in the humanities have adapted machine learning to solve the arduous, data-processing heavy problems of their domain. Machine learning automates the process of pattern-discovery by finding meaningful insights from real-world or generated data. It has proven itself to be highly valuable in business, health, and financial applications, among others. In the near future, understanding the basics of machine learning is going to be a must for people from any domain due to its widespread adoption.\"},\n",
